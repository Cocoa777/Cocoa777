            This movie is (ofcoruse) spiderman movie. as you can see in the above picture.â†‘
            <br>
            I saw this movie in my friends house.
            <br>
            I like the movie, and sond track too.
            <br>
            This movie used a lot of CG(just my opinion), so it's realistic.
